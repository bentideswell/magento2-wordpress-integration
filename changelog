## [Fixed]

## [3.28.19] - 2023-06-12
### [Changed]
- Changed WP theme to remove the title sanitization for the query. The URL is used
  as its found. This fixes an issue where adding spaces into the URL still loaded

  should be in the format: HOST:PORT:IP so an example would be:
  www.yoursite.com:443:127.0.0.1

## [3.18.1] - 2022-07-22
### [Changed]
